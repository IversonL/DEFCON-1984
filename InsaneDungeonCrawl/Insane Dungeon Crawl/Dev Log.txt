Development Log for Insane Dungeon Crawl (A 24 hour programming experience)
Hour 1:
  First 20 Minutes:
   -Created 20 by 20 tiled grid or 400 total tiles.
  - Changed to 10 x 10 grid
  - Created Grid Array/Tile Click Events
  -Player Movement Created

Hour 2:
  -Created Basic Map Render Function
  -Added Collision Detection
  -Created a function to read in Map data and then display it
  -Attempted to create an algorithm and several functions for procedurally generating a map.
  -After doing some paper work and writing code I realized this will not be realistic in my current
  time frame and decided to create a predesigned map with random item and enemy generation.

Hour 3:
  -Begin planning out Map on graph paper
  -Decide instead of clearing 100 rooms the player is tasked with retrieving 11 Orbs representing the soul
  of the evil Lich Galanaaaaar. The A's being silent
  -Created multiple rooms and Maps
  -Begin work on enemy creation
  -created basic enemy creation function using a Masterlist of each enemies position, map and type

Hour 4:
  -Began programming Enemy A.I
  -Totally broke everything, had to restart from previous point
  -Basic Movement and Collision Detection for Enemies completed
Hour 5:
  -Began programming combat and interaction
  -Changed priority to terminal as I'll need it for logging combat
  -Base console created, going to spend the next couple of minutes working on features
Hour 6:
  -Currently experiencing issues with enemies, initially The Master list wouldn't display any enemies above an index of 1,
  they now display but won't move.
  -Enemy issue fixed by removing EnemyCount Variables
Hour 7:
  -Created an EnemyDeath and PlayerDeath function
  -Decided on including Permadeath
  -Added a gameloop that now handles EnemyMovement
  -Working on a EnemyPathfinder function
  -Pathfinding Function now working, had to fix collision detection for it
  -Final Enemy not appearing on Map 4, need to troubleshoot.
Hour 8:
  -I realized that the error was related to the enemies spawning on each other, I'm not sure
  exactly why this causes the other not to spawn but it works for now.
  -Collision detection was all fuckey(fuckie?) so I had to rework the logic slightly so enemies wouldn't run into falls and then
  glitch off onto unreachable area's of the map
Hour 9:
  -Decided on creating physical bullets to interact in the environment rather then creating a line of site function to directly
  check if an attack lands. This will create a more pleasing visual style along with making things easier for myself as I can simply
  do a collision bounds check for the bullets. Though I won't allow the weapon to fire unless an enemy is clicked.
